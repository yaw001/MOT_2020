            objects of each pair simultaneously intercept at the center of the respective quadrant.

            Make sure you select one from each pair (total 4 targets). The click will be disabled if you
            are trying to select both targets from the same pair. To change your decision, you have to first unclick the
            one you clicked from the pair and then click the other
            one.
