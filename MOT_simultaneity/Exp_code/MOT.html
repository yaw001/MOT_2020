            Consent to act as a research subject</h1>
        <p> Edward Vul, Ph.D. is conducting a research study about multiple object tracking.
            You have been asked to participate because you are an undergraduate here at UCSD. <br><br>
            <b>PROCEDURES.</b> If you agree to participate in this study, the following will happen to you:<br>
            1. You will sit at the computer and see displays of circle objects and some of them will be highlighted as targets.<br>
            2. You will try to track them for a period of time and report your tracked targets by clicking the objects.<br><br>
            <b>RISKS</b>. No potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some tasks
            may be slightly boring.<br><br>
            PAYMENT/REMUNERATION<b></b>. In consideration of your time and inconvenience, you will receive half hour of
            course credit. The procedures and length of participation will last approximately 20 minutes.<br><br>
            <b>RIGHTS.</b> You may call the UCSD Human Research Protection Program at 858-657- 5100 to ask about your
            rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.<br><br>
            <b>BENEFITS</b>. There will be no direct benefit to you from these procedures. However, the investigator may
            learn more about basic questions pertaining to attention, memory, perception, cognition.<br><br>
            <b>EXPLANATION.</b> The researcher has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you have
            questions or research related problems, you may reach Edward Vul at 858-534- 4401.<br><br>
            <b>VOLUNTARY NATURE OF PARTICIPATION.</b> Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to
            participate or withdraw at any time without penalty.<br><br>
            <b>CONFIDENTIALITY.</b> Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. As with all
            research, there is also the possibility of loss of confidentiality. Information from participants will be
            identified by a study number. The database which relates the study number to a specific subject will be
            maintained in the study coordinators office.<br><br>
            <b>COPY OF CONSENT.</b> You have received a copy of this consent document to keep and a copy of the
            Experimental Bill of Rights.

            The highlights disappear and 8 objects start to move around in pairs and transition across the vertice. Your
            task is to track the targets for 8 seconds (8 transitionsï¼‰while fixating at the fixation point. During the 8 seconds of tracking, the objects will move while they are well separated for most of the time.
            There are four different types of trials illustrated below:
            <br>
            <br>Type one: Throughout tracking, the objects are all well separated all the time.

            <br>Type two: Throughout tracking, the objects are all well separated except for four transitions where one 
            of the random pairs of objects will intercept at the center of each quadrant will be randomly selected (each
            pair only intercepts once). There are two types of interception shown below (opposite vs. neighboring
            positions).<br>
            <br>Two objects intercept starting from opposite positions.

            <br><u>Remember, there are 3 similar transitions for the other three pairs so that all the pairs undergo the interception by the end of the trial.</u>

            of the random pairs of objects will intercept at the center of each quadrant will be randomly selected (each
