                Consent to act as a research subject</h1>
            <p> Edward Vul, Ph.D. is conducting a research study about multiple object tracking.
                You have been asked to participate because you are an undergraduate here at UCSD. <br><br>
                <b>PROCEDURES.</b> If you agree to participate in this study, the following will happen to you:<br>
                1. You will sit at the computer and see displays of circle objects and some of them will be highlighted
                as targets.<br>
                2. You will try to track them for a period of time and report your tracked targets by clicking the
                objects.<br><br>
                <b>RISKS</b>. No potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some
                tasks
                may be slightly boring.<br><br>
                PAYMENT/REMUNERATION<b></b>. In consideration of your time and inconvenience, you will receive half hour
                of
                course credit. The procedures and length of participation will last approximately 20 minutes.<br><br>
                <b>RIGHTS.</b> You may call the UCSD Human Research Protection Program at 858-657- 5100 to ask about
                your
                rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.<br><br>
                <b>BENEFITS</b>. There will be no direct benefit to you from these procedures. However, the investigator
                may
                learn more about basic questions pertaining to attention, memory, perception, cognition.<br><br>
                <b>EXPLANATION.</b> The researcher has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you
                have
                questions or research related problems, you may reach Edward Vul at 858-534- 4401.<br><br>
                <b>VOLUNTARY NATURE OF PARTICIPATION.</b> Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may
                refuse to
                participate or withdraw at any time without penalty.<br><br>
                <b>CONFIDENTIALITY.</b> Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. As with
                all
                research, there is also the possibility of loss of confidentiality. Information from participants will
                be
                identified by a study number. The database which relates the study number to a specific subject will be
                maintained in the study coordinators office.<br><br>
                <b>COPY OF CONSENT.</b> You have received a copy of this consent document to keep and a copy of the
                Experimental Bill of Rights.

                Here is a display with a fixation point at the center. In each quadrant, there is one 
                object and it is randomly spawned at one of the four positions of rectangle vertex.

                When the trial starts, four objects will start moving in parabolic paths and transition to one of the 4 locations

                Throughout the movement of the objects, there will be three different scenarios where one of the random objects
                will move in a distinctive path from the other three objects.
                The first condition is "position condition" where the object moves to half way (the vertex of the 
                parabolic path) and jumps to a different point to continue the second half of the parabolic path:
                <img src="img/position.png" alt="instruction_4" class="center" style="width: 55%">
                The second condition is "velocity condition" where the object moves to half way (the vertex of the parabolic path)
                and moves back to the starting point following the same parabolic path.
                <img src="img/velocity.png" alt="instruction_4" class="center" style="width: 55%">
                The third condition is "acceleration condition" where the object moves to half way (the vertex of the parabolic path)
                and it continues in a different parabolic path that is symmetrical about the center.
                <img src="img/acceleration.png" alt="instruction_4" class="center" style="width: 55%">
                Other conditions:

                detect the object that has distinctive movement and path throughout the movement. All conditions will be randomized.

                All objects will move in exactly one transition for one second. After the objects stop moving,
                click the object on which you think the path change has occurred. There will be a black highlighted
                circle around the object you clicked on. You can de-select the object by clicking the object again and choose
                whichever at your will. The submit button is enabled when you select one object and disabled when nothing is selected.
